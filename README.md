# Summary #
This code is used in the [The Helmholtz Equation in Heterogeneous and Random Media: Analysis and Numerics](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/the-helmholtz-equation-in-heterogeneous-and-random-media-analysis) (release 'Thesis version') and the paper [Analysis of a Helmholtz preconditioning problem motivated by uncertainty quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13390) (release 'Paper version').

See [this repository](https://github.com/orpembery/thesis) for more information on the usage of the code in the thesis, as well as instructions on how to download and use the code.

Note that (for 'Paper version') the plotting scripts in `nbpc-scaling-linfinty/plots` are duplicated from the thesis repository, and modified to produce the graphics in the paper. Also note that there are additional numerical experiments in the paper that are not contained in the thesis.
